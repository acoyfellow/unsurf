title: Your first unsurf
description: Deploy unsurf and capture your first API in 5 minutes.

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import SourceCode from '../../components/SourceCode.astro';

We will deploy unsurf to your Cloudflare account and use the **scout** tool to capture every API endpoint on a public website. By the end, you will have a complete OpenAPI spec generated automatically.

## Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed
- An API key from Cloudflare (for Alchemy deployment)

## Deploy

<Steps>

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acoyfellow/unsurf
   cd unsurf
   bun install
   ```

2. **Set your Alchemy password**

   ```bash
   echo 'ALCHEMY_PASSWORD=your-secure-password' > .env
   ```

3. **Deploy to Cloudflare**

   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

   Alchemy will create your D1 database, R2 bucket, and Browser Rendering binding automatically. You will see a URL in the output — that is your unsurf instance.

</Steps>

## Scout your first site

Now we will capture the API behind [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), a free public API.

Set your deployed URL as an environment variable (shown in the `bun run deploy` output):

```bash
export UNSURF_URL="https://unsurf.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev"
```

<Steps>

1. **Call the scout tool**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST $UNSURF_URL/tools/scout \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "url": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
       "task": "discover all API endpoints"
     }'
   ```

2. **Read the result**

   The response contains:
   - `siteId` — the unique identifier for this site
   - `endpointCount` — how many endpoints were captured
   - `pathId` — a replayable path
   - `openApiSpec` — a complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification

3. **View captured endpoints**

   ```bash
   curl $UNSURF_URL/sites/{siteId}/endpoints
   ```

   You will see every endpoint that was called during the scout — `GET /posts`, `GET /posts/:id`, `GET /users`, and more — each with inferred request and response schemas.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
The scout captured these endpoints by watching network traffic through Chrome DevTools Protocol — the same technique your browser's Network tab uses, automated.
</Aside>

## What happened

unsurf launched a headless browser on Cloudflare's edge, navigated to the site, and captured every XHR/fetch request. For each unique endpoint, it:

1. Normalized the URL pattern (`/posts/1` → `/posts/:id`)
2. Inferred a JSON Schema from the response body
3. Saved everything to D1 (via Drizzle) and R2
4. Generated an OpenAPI 3.1 spec from all captured endpoints

You now have a typed API definition for a site that may have no public documentation.

Here is how a captured endpoint is represented internally:
