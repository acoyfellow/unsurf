The **API Gallery** is a community-contributed registry of unsurfed APIs. Every time anyone scouts a site, the captured OpenAPI spec gets published to the gallery. Agents search the gallery before scouting — if someone already unsurfed that site, skip the browser entirely.

**One line:** _Scout once, share forever._

## What is the Gallery

The gallery is both a **read cache** (check before scouting) and a **write-through cache** (populated by scouting). The more people scout, the more the gallery knows.

Each gallery entry tracks:

| Field | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `domain` | The API's domain (e.g. `api.stripe.com`) |
| `endpointCount` | How many endpoints were captured |
| `endpointsSummary` | Human-readable list of methods + paths |
| `specKey` | Pointer to the full OpenAPI spec in R2 |
| `contributor` | Who published it |
| `version` | Bumped on each re-publish |

```
scout(url, task)
  │
  ├─ 1. Check gallery for domain  →  found? return cached spec (skip browser)
  │
  ├─ 2. No hit → run normal scout
  │
  └─ 3. After scout succeeds → publish to gallery
```

## Searching for APIs

Search by domain, endpoint path, or description:

```bash
# By domain
curl "https://unsurf.coy.workers.dev/gallery?domain=api.stripe.com"

# By keyword
curl "https://unsurf.coy.workers.dev/gallery?q=payment"

# With limit
curl "https://unsurf.coy.workers.dev/gallery?q=users&limit=5"
```

<Aside>
At least one of `q` or `domain` is required.
</Aside>

Programmatically, use the `Gallery` service:

```typescript
import { makeTestGallery, makeTestStore } from "unsurf";
import { Effect } from "effect";

const store = makeTestStore();
const gallery = makeTestGallery(store);

// Search by keyword
const results = await Effect.runPromise(gallery.search("stripe"));

// Look up by exact domain — use this to check cache before scouting
const entry = await Effect.runPromise(gallery.getByDomain("api.stripe.com"));
if (entry) {
  console.log(`Cache hit! ${entry.endpointCount} endpoints, v${entry.version}`);
}
```

## Publishing your discoveries

After scouting, publish the captured API to share it with everyone:

<Steps>

1. **Scout a site** — this creates a `siteId` and captures endpoints.

2. **Publish** — pass the `siteId` to the gallery. The gallery extracts the domain, endpoints, and OpenAPI spec.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://unsurf.coy.workers.dev/gallery/publish" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"siteId": "site_abc123", "contributor": "your-name"}'
   ```

3. **Re-publish** — if you scout the same domain again, publishing bumps the version instead of creating a duplicate.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Scout automatically publishes to the gallery by default. Pass `publish: false` to opt out.
</Aside>

Fetch the complete OpenAPI spec for any gallery entry:

```bash
curl "https://unsurf.coy.workers.dev/gallery/gal_abc123/spec"
```

## MCP Tool Usage

The `gallery` MCP tool lets agents search the gallery before deciding whether to scout:

```json
{
  "name": "gallery",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "payment API",
    "domain": "stripe.com"
  }
}
```

A well-prompted agent should:
1. **Check the gallery first** — if the domain is already there, use the cached spec
2. **Scout only on cache miss** — saves browser resources
3. **Publish after scouting** — grows the gallery for everyone

## Full example

This example seeds a test store, publishes to the gallery, searches, and checks the domain cache:
